SQL is a vital skill for data analysts. While I've had a solid foundation in the core SQL concepts, I knew I needed to solidify my understanding and apply it to real-world problems. \
To address this, I've spent the past few months honing my SQL skills through Data Camp's Associate Data Analyst in SQL track. I've also been actively practicing on LeetCode to tackle interview questions and sharpen my problem-solving skills. This combination is preparing me for Data Camp's Associate Data Analyst certification that I'm currently pursuing. \
Taking my SQL journey a step further, I'm excited to participate in [Danny Ma's 8WeekSQLChallenge](https://8weeksqlchallenge.com/). 
Throughout this challenge, I'll be working through the provided case studies and documenting my learnings and thought processes here. You'll find my write-ups on the case studies below.
